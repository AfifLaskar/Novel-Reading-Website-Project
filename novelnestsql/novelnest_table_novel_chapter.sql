(789001, 1, 'The Awakening', 'Yuta Okkotsu\'s eyes fluttered open, the memory of his dream fading like mist in the morning sun. His heart raced, his breaths coming in ragged gasps as he struggled to shake off the remnants of sleep. But even as consciousness pulled him from the depths of slumber, a heavy weight pressed upon his chest, the weight of a nightmare he couldn\'t quite remember.\r\n\r\nSitting up in bed, Yuta glanced around his dimly lit room, the familiar surroundings offering little comfort in the wake of his unsettling dream. The walls seemed to close in on him, shadows dancing across the peeling wallpaper like whispers of forgotten secrets. It was a feeling he\'d grown accustomed to—a feeling of unease that had plagued him for as long as he could remember.\r\n\r\nBut today was different. Today, the world felt charged with an energy he couldn\'t quite explain—a sense of anticipation that prickled at the edges of his consciousness like static in the air. And as he pushed himself to his feet, his mind buzzing with unspoken questions, he knew that something had changed.\r\n\r\nDressing quickly, Yuta made his way downstairs, the wooden floorboards creaking beneath his weight. His mother greeted him with a weary smile, her eyes betraying the exhaustion that lingered just beneath the surface. It was a look Yuta knew all too well—a look that spoke of nights spent tossing and turning, haunted by dreams of a past they could never escape.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Yuta,\" his mother said, her voice tinged with a hint of sadness. \"Did you sleep well?\"\r\n\r\nYuta forced a smile, though he knew it didn\'t reach his eyes. \"As well as can be expected,\" he replied, his words heavy with unspoken truths. \"Is there anything I can help with today?\"\r\n\r\nHis mother shook her head, her smile fading as she turned back to the stove. \"No, dear,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. \"Just take care of yourself, okay? That\'s all I ask.\"\r\n\r\nYuta nodded, though the weight of her words hung heavy on his shoulders. It was a burden he\'d carried for as long as he could remember—a burden he\'d tried to shoulder alone, for fear of burdening those he loved. But today, as he watched his mother\'s weary form move about the kitchen, he knew that he couldn\'t keep his secrets hidden any longer.\r\n\r\nLeaving his mother to her chores, Yuta stepped out into the cool morning air, the sun just beginning to rise on the horizon. The streets were quiet, the city still half-asleep as it prepared to face another day. But for Yuta, the world seemed to pulse with a newfound energy—a sense of purpose that tugged at his soul like a distant memory.\r\n\r\nAnd as he made his way through the quiet streets, his mind buzzing with unanswered questions, he knew that today would mark the beginning of a journey he could never turn back from.', 7510),

With dreams as vast as the open sky, she longed to escape the monotony of her daily routine and explore the world beyond the horizon.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Taki Tachibana, a determined and hardworking boy, navigated the bustling streets of Tokyo with a sense of purpose and ambition. Focused on his studies and part-time job, he barely had time to spare for anything beyond the demands of his busy schedule.\r\n\r\nDespite their vastly different lives, Mitsuha and Taki shared a common thread—a strange and inexplicable connection that bound their fates together across time and space. Through a series of vivid dreams and fleeting glimpses, they found themselves slipping into each other\'s lives with startling clarity and familiarity.\r\n\r\nFor Mitsuha, it began with a sense of deja vu—a feeling that she had lived another life entirely, one filled with unfamiliar faces and distant memories. And for Taki, it started with a strange urge to reach out to someone he had never met, a longing that gnawed at his heart with each passing day.\r\n\r\nAs they grappled with the mystery of their connection, Mitsuha and Taki embarked on a journey of self-discovery and exploration—a journey that would take them to the very edges of reality and beyond. With each encounter, they found themselves drawn closer together, their destinies entwined in ways they could scarcely comprehend.\r\n\r\nAnd as the threads of fate began to weave their intricate tapestry, Mitsuha and Taki realized that their meeting was no mere coincidence, but the beginning of an extraordinary adventure that would transcend the boundaries of time and space.', 7511),
(789003, 1, 'Prologue', 'Reincarnated into a new world filled with magic and monsters, the king has a second chance to relive his life. Correcting the mistakes of his past will not be his only challenge, however. Underneath the peace and prosperity of the new world is an undercurrent threatening to destroy everything he has worked for, questioning his role and reason for being born again.\r\nI never believed in the whole \"light at the end of the tunnel\" folly where people, after experiencing near-death experiences, would startle awake in a cold sweat exclaiming, \"I saw the light!\" But here I am currently at this so-called \"tunnel\" facing a glaring light, when the last thing I remember was sleeping in my room (others call it the royal chamber).\r\n\r\nDid I die? If so, how? Was I assassinated? I don\'t remember wronging anyone, but then again, being a powerful public figure gave others all sorts of reasons to want me dead. Anyway… Since it didn\'t seem like I was going to wake up anytime soon, while I slowly gravitated towards this bright light, I might as well go along with it.\r\n\r\nThe journey seemed to take an eternity; I half expected a choir of children to be singing an angelic hymn, beckoning me towards what I hoped would be heaven.\r\n\r\nInstead, my vision of everything around me turned into a blur of bright red as sounds assaulted my ears. When I tried to say something, the only sound that came out seemed to be a cry.\r\n\r\nThe muffled voices became clearer and I made out a: \"Congratulations Sir and Madam, he\'s a healthy boy.\" …Wait. I guess normally, I should be thinking along the lines of \"Shit, was I just born? Am I a baby now?\" But strangely, the only thought that seemed to pop up in my mind was, \'So the bright light at the end of the tunnel is the light coming through into the female vag…\' Haha... let\'s not think about it anymore.\r\n\r\nAssessing my situation in a rational king-like manner, I noticed, first of all, that wherever this place was, I understood the language. That\'s always a good sign. Next, after slowly and painfully opening my eyes, my retinas were bombarded with different colors and figures. It took a bit of time for my infant eyes to get used to the light. The doctor, or so it seemed, in front of me had a not-so-appealing face with long, greying hair on both head and chin. I swear his glasses were thick enough to be bulletproof. The strange thing was, he wasn\'t wearing a doctor\'s gown nor were we even in a hospital room.\r\n\r\nI seemed to have been born from some satanic summoning ritual because this room was lit only by a couple of candles and we were on the floor over a bed of straw.\r\n\r\nI looked around and saw the female who pushed me out of her tunnel. Calling her mother should be fair. Taking a few more seconds to see what she looked like, I\'d have to admit she\'s a beauty, but that might have been caused by my half blurry eyes. Rather than a glamorous beauty, I would better describe her as lovely, in a very kind and gentle sense, with distinct auburn hair and brown eyes. I couldn\'t help but notice her long eyelashes and perky nose that made me want to just cling to her. She just permeated this motherly feel. Is this why babies were attracted to their mothers?\r\n\r\nI peeled my face away and turned right to barely make out the person who I assumed was my father by the idiotic grin and teary eyes he gazed at me with. Immediately he said, \"Hi little Art, I\'m your daddy, can you say dada?\" I glanced around to see both my mother and the house doctor (for all the certification he seemed to have), roll their eyes as my mother managed to scoff, \"Honey, he was just born.\" I took a closer look at my father and I can see why my lovely mother was attracted to him. Besides the few loose screws he seemed to have by expecting a newborn to articulate a two-syllable word (I\'m just going to give him the benefit of the doubt and think he said that out of the joy of becoming a father), he was a very charismatic-looking man with a cleanly shaven square jawline that complimented his features. His hair, a very ashy brown color, seemed to be kept trim, while his eyebrows were strong and fierce, extending in a sword-like fashion meeting to a V shape. Yet, his eyes held a gentle quality, whether it was from the way his eyes drooped a bit at the end or from the deep blue, almost sapphire, hue that radiated from his irises.\r\n\r\n\"Hmm, he isn\'t crying. Doctor, I thought newborns were supposed to cry when they are born.\" I heard my mother\'s voice. By the time I finished checking out… I mean observing my parents; the wannabe doctor simply excused himself saying, \"There are cases where the infant does not cry. Please continue resting for a couple of days Mrs. Leywin, and let me know if anything happens to Arthur, Mr. Leywin.\"\r\n\r\nThe following couple of weeks after my journey out of the tunnel was a new kind of torture for me. I had little to no motor control over my limbs except being able to wave them around, and even that got tiring quickly. I realized all too grudgingly that babies don\'t really get to control their fingers all that much.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know how to break it to you guys, but when you place your finger on a baby\'s palm, they don\'t grab it because they like you, they grab it because it\'s like getting hit in the funny bone; it\'s a reflex. Forget motor control, I can\'t even excrete my wastes at my discretion. I was not yet the master of my own bladder. It just… came out. Haa…\r\n\r\nOn the bright side, one of the few perks that I became happily accustomed to was being breastfed by my mother.\r\n\r\nDon\'t get me wrong, I had no ulterior motives whatsoever. It\'s just that breast milk tasted a lot better than baby formula and has better nutritional value, okay? Er… please believe me.\r\n\r\n', 7513),
(789004, 1, 'The Calm Before the Storm', 'In the heart of Konoha, a young Itachi Uchiha walked through the village streets, his expression serene yet distant. At thirteen, he was already an ANBU captain, known for his prodigious skills and deep wisdom. However, the burden of his clan\'s looming rebellion weighed heavily on his shoulders.\r\n\r\nItachi\'s days were a delicate balancing act between his duties as a shinobi and the increasing pressure from his clan. The Uchiha were growing restless, their distrust of the village leadership festering into thoughts of insurrection. Fugaku Uchiha, Itachi\'s father and the clan leader, often spoke to him about the need for change, but Itachi saw the potential for disaster in these plans.\r\n\r\nOne evening, Itachi returned home to find his younger brother, Sasuke, eagerly waiting for him. Sasuke idolized Itachi, aspiring to be as strong and respected as his brother. Itachi\'s heart ached at the thought of what the future might hold for Sasuke, should the clan\'s tensions escalate into violence.\r\n\r\n\"Niisan, can we train together?\" Sasuke\'s eyes sparkled with hope.\r\n\r\nItachi smiled softly, ruffling Sasuke\'s hair. \"Of course, Sasuke. Let\'s go to the training ground.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the setting sun, the brothers sparred, Itachi carefully guiding Sasuke through each move, correcting his stances, and encouraging him. Despite the chaos brewing around him, these moments with Sasuke brought Itachi a sense of peace and purpose. They moved in synchrony, their Sharingan eyes flashing red as they anticipated each other’s moves. Itachi couldn’t help but feel a pang of regret—he wished he could protect Sasuke from the dark future that seemed inevitable.\r\n\r\nAfter their training session, they sat by a small stream, the water gently flowing past them. Sasuke looked up at Itachi with admiration. \"Niisan, do you think I\'ll ever be as strong as you?\"\r\n\r\nItachi looked at his brother, his heart swelling with both pride and sadness. \"Sasuke, you have the potential to become even stronger than me. But remember, true strength comes from protecting those you love and staying true to your principles.\"\r\n\r\nAs night fell, the two brothers walked back home, the village bathed in the soft glow of lanterns. They passed by the Uchiha clan compound, where murmurs of discontent were becoming louder. Itachi knew he had to find a way to navigate the growing tension.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Itachi attended a secret meeting of the Uchiha clan elders. The room was filled with a palpable sense of urgency and frustration. Fugaku stood at the head of the table, his expression stern.\r\n\r\n\"The village leadership continues to marginalize us,\" Fugaku said, his voice filled with resolve. \"We must act now, or the Uchiha will forever be relegated to the shadows.\"\r\n\r\nThe elders nodded in agreement, their faces grim. Itachi, standing silently in the corner, felt a deep sense of unease. He respected his father and understood the clan\'s grievances, but he also saw the dangerous path they were treading.\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting, Fugaku approached Itachi. \"What do you think, Itachi? You’ve always been wise beyond your years.\"\r\n\r\nItachi chose his words carefully. \"Father, I understand the clan\'s frustrations, but we must find a way to address them without resorting to violence. War will only bring more suffering.\"\r\n\r\nFugaku\'s eyes softened for a moment, but his resolve remained unshaken. \"You have a good heart, Itachi. But sometimes, to protect what we love, we must be willing to fight.\"\r\n\r\nThat night, Itachi walked alone through the village, lost in thought. He found himself at the Memorial Stone, where the names of fallen shinobi were inscribed. He placed his hand on the cold stone, feeling the weight of his ancestors\' sacrifices.\r\n\r\n\"Itachi.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice was calm and familiar. Itachi turned to see Shisui Uchiha, his closest friend and confidant. Shisui’s presence was a rare comfort in these troubled times.\r\n\r\n\"Shisui, I\'m glad you\'re here,\" Itachi said quietly.\r\n\r\nShisui nodded, his expression serious. \"The situation with the clan is escalating. We need to find a solution before it\'s too late.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" Itachi replied. \"But I\'m not sure what to do. I want to protect the clan, but I also have a duty to the village.\"\r\n\r\nShisui placed a hand on Itachi\'s shoulder. \"We\'ll figure it out together. You\'re not alone in this.\"\r\n\r\nAs the night deepened, Itachi and Shisui stood side by side, the weight of their responsibilities pressing down on them. They knew that the days ahead would test their resolve and force them to make impossible choices. But in that moment, they drew strength from their bond, determined to find a way to protect both their clan and the village they loved.\r\n\r\nLittle did they know, the events set in motion that night would lead to a series of tragic and fateful decisions, forever altering the course of their lives and the history of the Uchiha clan.', 7514),

She rubbed her eyes, trying to shake off the lingering fragments of her dream. This wasn’t the first time she had experienced such vivid visions, but each time, the details seemed to grow clearer and more intense.\r\n\r\nIn her dream, she had been walking the bustling streets of Tokyo, navigating the maze of people and neon signs with an ease that felt second nature. She could remember the sensation of the city’s pulse, the aroma of street food mingling with the scent of rain-soaked concrete. It was as if she had lived an entire lifetime in the span of a single night.\r\n\r\nShaking her head, Mitsuha tried to focus on the present. Today was a special day in her town—the annual festival that brought the community together in celebration of their traditions and culture.

They can reveal things about ourselves and sometimes, about our future.”\r\n\r\nMitsuha pondered her grandmother’s words as she helped with the preparations. Could these dreams be more than just figments of her imagination? And what was the connection to the boy she saw so clearly in them?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, across the miles in the heart of Tokyo, Taki Tachibana jolted awake from his own dream.

This time, he had found himself in a quaint rural town, participating in rituals and routines that felt foreign yet familiar.\r\n\r\nTaki shook off the remnants of sleep and got ready for another day of school and work. His thoughts drifted to the girl he had seen in his dreams, her face etched with determination and a longing that mirrored his own.

There, written in unfamiliar handwriting, was a response.\r\n\r\n“I’m Taki. Who are you?”\r\n\r\nMitsuha’s excitement was palpable as she read the message. This was real.

He knew that the path ahead would be fraught with challenges and heartache, but he resolved to honor their bond by continuing to fight for the world they had once dreamed of protecting together.\r\n\r\nAnd so, with a heavy heart and a steely determination, Satoru set out to face the trials that lay ahead, the shadow of betrayal casting a long and foreboding shadow over his journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 7510132),
(789001, 4, 'Training', 'Yuta\'s days at the Jujutsu High School began with rigorous training sessions. Gojo and the other instructors introduced him to the basics of jujutsu sorcery, teaching him how to channel his innate energy to combat curses. The process was exhausting, both physically and mentally, but Yuta was determined to master the skills he needed to protect himself and others.\r\n\r\nMaki, along with two other students, Panda and Toge Inumaki, quickly became his friends and allies. Panda, despite his unusual appearance, was kind and supportive, while Toge, who communicated mostly through rice ball ingredients, had a quiet strength that Yuta found reassuring.\r\n\r\nOne day, during a particularly grueling training session, Gojo pulled Yuta aside. \"There\'s something you need to understand, Yuta. Your power—it\'s different from the others. It\'s stronger, more volatile. You need to learn to control it, or it will control you.\"\r\n\r\nYuta nodded, sweat dripping down his face. \"I understand. But why is my power different?\"\r\n\r\nGojo\'s expression grew serious. \"It\'s because of Rika.\"\r\n\r\nYuta\'s breath caught in his throat. The name sent a jolt of pain through his chest. \"Rika? What does she have to do with this?\"\r\n\r\nGojo sighed. \"Rika Orimoto was your childhood friend, wasn\'t she? She died in a car accident, but her spirit didn\'t pass on. Instead, she attached herself to you, becoming a powerful curse.\"\r\n\r\nYuta\'s eyes widened in shock. \"No... Rika was always kind and gentle. She wouldn\'t hurt anyone.\"\r\n\r\nGojo placed a hand on Yuta\'s shoulder. \"That\'s the tragic part. Her love for you was so strong that it transformed her into a curse. But that also means you have the power to harness her strength, to turn that curse into a force for good.\"\r\n\r\nTears filled Yuta\'s eyes as he processed Gojo\'s words. The memory of Rika\'s smile, her laughter, and the warmth of her friendship washed over him, mingling with the sorrow and guilt he\'d carried since her death.\r\n\r\n\"I\'ll do it,\" Yuta said, his voice trembling but resolute. \"I\'ll learn to control this power. For Rika\'s sake, and for mine.\"\r\n\r\nGojo smiled, a proud glint in his eyes. \"That\'s the spirit, Yuta. Together, we\'ll make sure you and Rika find peace.\"', 7510140),

(789001, 3, 'Revelation', 'Yuta\'s mind swirled with questions as he followed Gojo through the winding streets of the city. The stranger\'s words had opened a floodgate of emotions and memories that Yuta had long tried to suppress. He felt a strange mix of fear and excitement, a sense of stepping into a world that had always been just beyond his grasp.\r\n\r\nThey arrived at a large, imposing building that seemed out of place in the quiet neighborhood. Its high walls and iron gates gave it an air of secrecy and importance. Gojo led Yuta through the gates and into a courtyard, where several other people were gathered. They all looked up as the two approached, their expressions a mix of curiosity and recognition.\r\n\r\n\"This is the Tokyo Metropolitan Magic Technical College,\" Gojo explained. \"It\'s a place where people like us—those who can see and fight curses—come to train and learn.\"\r\n\r\nYuta\'s eyes widened. \"Curses? You mean like ghosts or evil spirits?\"\r\n\r\nGojo nodded. \"Something like that. Curses are born from negative human emotions. They feed on fear, hatred, and sorrow, and they can cause a lot of harm if left unchecked.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the students, a girl with short, dark hair and a determined look in her eyes, stepped forward. \"I\'m Maki Zenin,\" she said, offering Yuta a hand. \"Welcome to the world of Jujutsu Sorcerers.\"\r\n\r\nYuta shook her hand, feeling a sense of connection and camaraderie he hadn\'t felt in a long time. \"I\'m Yuta Okkotsu,\" he replied. \"I still don\'t fully understand what\'s happening, but I want to learn. I want to help.\"\r\n\r\nGojo smiled, this time with genuine warmth. \"You\'ll have plenty of time to learn, Yuta. For now, just know that you\'re not alone.

Despite the stillness around him, he couldn\'t shake the feeling that he was being watched. Every rustle of leaves, every distant chirp of a bird seemed to amplify his sense of unease.\r\n\r\nAs he turned a corner, Yuta\'s eyes caught a glimpse of something unusual. Standing in the middle of an otherwise empty street was a tall man, clad in a long, dark coat. His face was partially obscured by a hat, but what Yuta could see of his expression was intense, almost predatory.\r\n\r\nYuta felt a shiver run down his spine, but he forced himself to keep walking, trying to appear as if he hadn\'t noticed the stranger. His heart pounded in his chest, each beat echoing the steps he took away from the man. But the sense of being watched grew stronger, more insistent.\r\n\r\n\"Yuta Okkotsu,\" the man called out, his voice deep and resonant. It wasn\'t a question; it was a statement, a declaration of knowing. Yuta froze, his breath catching in his throat. He turned slowly to face the man, his mind racing with possibilities.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" Yuta asked, his voice trembling slightly despite his attempt to sound brave.\r\n\r\nThe man smiled, a thin, mirthless smile that didn\'t reach his eyes. \"My name is Satoru Gojo. I\'m here to help you.\"\r\n\r\nYuta frowned, confusion mingling with his fear. \"Help me? With what?\"\r\n\r\nGojo took a step closer, his movements graceful and deliberate. \"You\'ve been experiencing strange things, haven\'t you? Nightmares, feelings of being watched, a sense of something lurking just out of sight?\"\r\n\r\nYuta nodded hesitantly. How could this stranger know about the things that had haunted him for so long?\r\n\r\nGojo\'s smile widened, but it still lacked warmth. \"You\'re not alone, Yuta. There are others like you, others who can see and feel things that most people can\'t. You\'ve been chosen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chosen for what?\" Yuta\'s voice was barely above a whisper now, his fear giving way to curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"To learn the truth about who you are,\" Gojo replied, his tone serious. \"And to join the fight against the curses that plague our world.\"', 75101450);
